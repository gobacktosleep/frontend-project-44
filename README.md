### Project description:
This app contains five math mini-games that run from the console. Each game contains three rounds. If you answer all the questions correctly, the game will end with success. If you give a wrong answer, the game will ask you to play it again.

### Games description:
- **Parity check.** Given a random number and you have to answer "yes" if the number is even, or "no" if it is odd.
- **Calculator.** Shown a random mathematical expression that you have to calculate and write down the correct answer.
- **GCD.** Find the greatest common divisor of two given numbers.
- **Progression.** Find the missing element in the arithmetic progression.
- **Prime number.** Given a random number and you have to answer "yes" if the number is prime, or "no" if it is not. 

### Install the app:
Sequentially type these commands in your terminal
```
$ git clone https://github.com/gobacktosleep/frontend-project-44
$ cd frontend-project-44
$ make install
$ sudo npm link
```
[Installation example (asciinema)](https://asciinema.org/a/5Wfr8wGzyUtKEeJECvbH6g0NC)

After installation you can start using the app. 
Each game is launched with a specific command: 

| Game         | Command               |
| -----------  | -----------           |
| Parity check | `$ brain-even`        |
| Calculator   | `$ brain-calc`        |
| GCD          | `$ brain-gcd`         |
| Progression  | `$ brain-progression` |
| Prime number | `$ brain-prime`       |
